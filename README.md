I'm a master's student at POSTECH, and my research goal is to create an AI-Driven Decision Support System. Specifically, I've been concentrating on developing a practical recommender system that assists users in complex decision-making. My research spans various topics, including how to integrate a recommender system with areas such as Knowledge Distillation, Continual Learning, and a Diffusion Model. I've gained experience in Computer Vision, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning during my time at CMU. I'm open to collaboration, so please feel free to contact me anytime.
