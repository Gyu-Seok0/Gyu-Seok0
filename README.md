I am a researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).

I earned my M.S. degree in Artifical Intelligence at POSTECH under the guidance of <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/postechdi/home'> Prof. Hwanjo Yu </a>.

I completed my B.S. degree with a dual major in Computer Science and Mathematics/Statistics, graduating magna cum laude from Handong Global University.

My research interests lie in Information Retreiveal, Recommender Systems, Continual Learning, Knowledge Distillation, and Generative Methods (e.g., LLMs and Diffusion Models).

Iâ€™m open to collaboration, so please feel free to contact me (kbin6961@gmail.com).
